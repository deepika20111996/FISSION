The first line of the input.txt file represents the number contests they participate in. 
We read the later lines into a list
Now we access every number in the list   
If its a even number, minimum prime factor is 2
If its odd number then ,then we divide with every odd number in an increasing order until we find its first prime factor.
As we follow an increasing order the first odd number we come across that divides the number,  will be a minimum prime factor.
